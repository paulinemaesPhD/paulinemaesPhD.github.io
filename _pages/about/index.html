I am leading a research project, funded by a MSCA postdoctoral grant from the European Research Executive Agency, investigating the use of echolalia during social interactions in autistic preschoolers.</p> <p>Before making the big move across the pond, I earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from the Université libre de Bruxelles (Brussels, Belgium) where I worked at the <a href="https://acte.ulb.be/index.php/fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Autism in Context: Theory and Experiment</a> lab under the supervision of Dr. Mikhail Kissine. My dissertation sought to investigate visual social attention and profiles of expressive language, as well as their interrelationship, in autistic preschoolers, including many who had very limited spoken language.</p> <p>Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture.
